# Contributing to AndPermission
First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute.  

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to AndPermission. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

1. All your actions in AndPermission should be in English, not in other languages.
2. Please keep AndPermission the existing code style, not according to your habits.
3. Just modify the code you are sure need to be optimized, not all the different code from your ideas.
4. Before launching a pull request, you should test your commit code adequately.
5. Please commit new code to the [dev](https://github.com/yanzhenjie/AndPermission/tree/dev) branch instead of the master branch.
